To use ds-server: 
	Using a terminal in the COMP3100Project folder, enter:
	./ds-server -c sample-config01.xml -v brief -n

To use Client Side: 
	Using a seperate terminal in the COMP3100Project folder, enter:
	1. javac MyClient.java
	2. java MyClient
	
You may need to run these commands twice, after which the program will run correctly indefinitely. This may be because the ds-system.xml file is created the first time the program is run
